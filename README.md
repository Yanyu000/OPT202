## Project 1
This project explores the application of Newton's method for finding the static equilibrium of a chain composed of rigid bars in two-dimensional space. The problem is formulated as an optimization problem, with the constraints initially expressed as equalities. This formulation allows us to apply Newton's method to find the root of the non-linear system of equations, which in turn provides the desired static equilibrium. In the second part we transfer the constraints into inequalities in order to take advantage of convexity. By employing semi-definitive programming, we are able to efficiently solve the optimization problem.
